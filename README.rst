EGMS toolkit
############

**EGMS toolkit** is a set of python scripts to download and manage the InSAR data from `European Ground Motion Service <https://egms.land.copernicus.eu>`_. The toolkit allows:

* to download the data automatically; 
* to merge the files; 
* to clip/crop the datasets.  

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

**Release info**: Version 0.2.15 Beta, Apr., 2025

The online documentation can be found `here <https://alexisinsar.github.io/EGMStoolkit/>`_.

Dependencies and installation 
=============================

The requirements are:

* Python 3
* GDAL (best with >= 3.8.0)
* GMT (with GSHHG)

.. note:: 

    GDAL 3.8.0 (or higher) is required for data gridding. 

To install the **EGMS toolkit**, 

On Linux and MacOS: 

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/alexisInSAR/EGMStoolkit.git
    pip3 install -e EGMStoolkit

On Windows: 

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/alexisInSAR/EGMStoolkit.git
    py -m pip3 install -e EGMStoolkit

.. note::

    For an installation in protected directories, the path of the Sentinel-Burst-ID map could be modified.

Run the toolkit
===============

There are two ways to use the toolkit (in shell or in Python). 

**To use the EGMS toolkit, you must first obtain a temporary token from the EGMS website. Follow the steps below:**

1. Visit the `EGMS website <https://egms.land.copernicus.eu/>`_.
2. Log in using your credentials:

3. You will be redirected to the EU Login portal. Enter your credentials and click **Sign in**:

4. Once logged in, you'll be redirected back to the EGMS website. Click on **Geographic archive search**, then draw a small bounding box on the map to define your area of interest. Double-click to confirm the selection.  
   **Important:** avoid selecting a large area.

5. After selecting the area, click on **Download links**:

   .. image:: private/download_links_step.png
      :width: 750px

6. A ``.txt`` file will be downloaded. Open the file â€” it should contain download links similar to the example below:

   .. code-block:: text

      https://egms.land.copernicus.eu/insar-api/archive/download/EGMS_L3_E26N19_100km_E_2019_2023_2.zip?id=fce0bde58db242f2a0d8e59e06728ffe
      https://egms.land.copernicus.eu/insar-api/archive/download/EGMS_L3_E26N19_100km_U_2019_2023_2.zip?id=fce0bde58db242f2a0d8e59e06728ffe

7. The token is the string that follows ``id=`` in the URL. In the example above, the token is:

   ``fce0bde58db242f2a0d8e59e06728ffe``

   Copy this token and provide it to the EGMS toolkit when prompted.

.. note::  
   This token is temporary and may expire. If it does, simply repeat these steps to generate a new one.

**Please find an example of the script use in your shell terminal.**

.. code-block:: bash

    EGMStoolkit -l L2a,L2b -r 2018_2022 -t XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -b -6.427059639290446,53.2606655698541,-6.0952332730202095,53.41811986118854 -o ./Output_directory --track 1 --pass Ascending --nomerging -noclipping --quiet --clean

.. note:: 

    The -h option is useful to get a help, i.e., 
    
    .. code-block:: bash
        
        EGMStoolkit -h 

    The --docs option is useful to get the documentation of EGMS-toolkit: i.e., 

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        EGMStoolkit --docs     

**In addition, EGMStoolkit can be used in a Python environment: see the example in the EGMStoolkit documentation.**

Merging the L2 datasets
=======================

Due to the Sentinel-1 acquisition mode, EGMStoolkit offers two different methods of merging: 

* Without reducing duplicate of measurement points in burst/swath overlaps; 
* With reducing duplicate of measurement points in burst/swath overlaps based on the convace-hull algorithm.

The method can be selected by modifing (True or False) the option *__removeduplicate__*. The *__length_threshold__* can be used for the same function (1000 by default). 

The VRT format can be used for the merging and interpolation steps.
